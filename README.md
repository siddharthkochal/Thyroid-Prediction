# Thyroid disease detection 
You will create a presentation about the process of designing an ML model for a classification problem - detecting thyroid diseases. Your dataset is attached, with binaryClass being your target variable (P - positive, disease exists). The presentation should take 15 minutes and describe all your modelling steps, including:
- short introduction to the dataset and the explanation of the problem (remember, 6 groups will talk about it),
- any data cleaning and preprocessing, including dealing with class imbalance and coping with missing values,
- descriptive and visual analysis of the dataset,
- modelling efforts: one tree-based ensemble model, one other model, tuning using a different method for both models (but not GridSearch), with repeated k-fold cross-validation,
- SHAP analysis for tree-based predictions,
- qualitative and quantitative comparison of predictions coming from both methods,
- ensembling the two models,
- final model selection.

Use the random seed of 13 wherever it is needed.

Remember, you will not be graded only on the goodness of fit (which won't be that hard to get good) - but rather on the coherence of the whole process.

In your presentation, include the information about who did what within the projects (generally, not too detailed), so we do not have any free riders in the groups.
Return to me the presentation and the full working code in such a way, that I can run it with no modifications, assuming that the input file is in the same folder as the code files. You will present during the class taking place on May 15.
